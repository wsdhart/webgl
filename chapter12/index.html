	  <p>
	    'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
	    large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a
	    hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
	    upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
	    they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
	    she had accidentally upset the week before.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Oh, I <i>beg</i> your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
	    began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
	    the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
	    that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
	    they would die.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until
	    all the jurymen are back in their proper places&mdash;<i>all</i>,' he repeated
	    with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the
	    Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail
	    about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out
	    again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said to
	    herself; 'I should think it would be <i>quite</i> as much use in the trial one
	    way up as the other.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset,
	    and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they
	    set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all
	    except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit
	    with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Nothing,' said Alice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Nothing <i>whatever</i>?' persisted the King.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were
	    just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
	    interrupted: '<i>Un</i>important, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a
	    very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    '<i>Un</i>important, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on to
	    himself in an undertone,
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'important&mdash;unimportant&mdash;unimportant&mdash;important&mdash;' as
	    if he were trying which word sounded best.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.' Alice
	    could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; 'but it
	    doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his
	    note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule
	    Forty-two. <i>All persons more than a mile high to leave the court</i>.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Everybody looked at Alice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    '<i>I'm</i> not a mile high,' said Alice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'You are,' said the King.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a
	    regular rule: you invented it just now.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your
	    verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White
	    Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked up.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'What's in it?' said the Queen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a
	    letter, written by the prisoner to&mdash;to somebody.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to nobody,
	    which isn't usual, you know.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's
	    nothing written on the <i>outside</i>.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
	    added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing
	    about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury all
	    brightened up again.)
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they can't
	    prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter worse.
	    You <i>must</i> have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name
	    like an honest man.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
	    clever thing the King had said that day.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'That <i>proves</i> his guilt,' said the Queen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know
	    what they're about!'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Read them,' said the King.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please your
	    Majesty?' he asked.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you come
	    to the end: then stop.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    These were the verses the White Rabbit read:&mdash;
	  </p>
	  <pre xml:space="preserve">
	    'They told me you had been to her,
	    And mentioned me to him:
	    She gave me a good character,
	    But said I could not swim.

	    He sent them word I had not gone
	    (We know it to be true):
	    If she should push the matter on,
	    What would become of you?

	    I gave her one, they gave him two,
	    You gave us three or more;
	    They all returned from him to you,
	    Though they were mine before.

	    If I or she should chance to be
	    Involved in this affair,
	    He trusts to you to set them free,
	    Exactly as we were.

	    My notion was that you had been
	    (Before she had this fit)
	    An obstacle that came between
	    Him, and ourselves, and it.

	    Don't let him know she liked them best,
	    For this must ever be
	    A secret, kept from all the rest,
	    Between yourself and me.'
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the
	    King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury&mdash;'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large
	    in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,)
	    'I'll give him sixpence. <i>I</i> don't believe there's an atom of meaning
	    in it.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The jury all wrote down on their slates, '<i>She</i> doesn't believe there's an
	    atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of
	    trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'
	    he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with
	          one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "&mdash;<i>said I
	      could not swim</i>&mdash;" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the
	    Knave.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he
	    certainly did <i>not</i>, being made entirely of cardboard.)
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the
	    verses to himself: '"<i>We know it to be true</i>&mdash;" that's the jury, of
	    course&mdash;"<i>I gave her one, they gave him two</i>&mdash;" why, that must be
	    what he did with the tarts, you know&mdash;'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'But, it goes on "<i>they all returned from him to you</i>,"' said Alice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
	          on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than <i>that</i>. Then again&mdash;"<i>before
	      she had this fit</i>&mdash;" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to
	    the Queen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as
	    she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate
	    with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began
	    again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it
	    lasted.)
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Then the words don't <i>fit</i> you,' said the King, looking round the court
	    with a smile. There was a dead silence.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
	    'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the
	    twentieth time that day.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first&mdash;verdict afterwards.'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the sentence
	    first!'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'I won't!' said Alice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
	    moved.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this
	    time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
	    her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried
	    to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in
	    the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that
	    had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've
	    had!'
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister,
	    as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers
	    that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her
	    sister kissed her, and said, 'It <i>was</i> a curious dream, dear, certainly: but
	    now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off,
	    thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had
	    been.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
	    hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
	    wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
	    this was her dream:&mdash;
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands
	    were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into
	    hers&mdash;she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer
	    little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that <i>would</i> always
	    get into her eyes&mdash;and still as she listened, or seemed to listen,
	    the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her
	    little sister's dream.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by&mdash;the
	    frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool&mdash;she
	    could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
	    shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering
	    off her unfortunate guests to execution&mdash;once more the pig-baby was
	    sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it&mdash;once
	    more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
	    slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the
	    air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,
	    though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to
	    dull reality&mdash;the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the
	    pool rippling to the waving of the reeds&mdash;the rattling teacups would
	    change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice
	    of the shepherd boy&mdash;and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the
	    Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
	    confused clamour of the busy farm-yard&mdash;while the lowing of the
	    cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy
	    sobs.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would,
	    in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep,
	    through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood:
	    and how she would gather about her other little children, and make <i>their</i>
	    eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the
	    dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their
	    simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering
	    her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
